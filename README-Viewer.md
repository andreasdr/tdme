==========

    - What is it?
        - TDME based 3D model asset viewer 

    - What is already working
        - model loading
        	- DAE, Wavefront OBJ, TMM meta data files
        - model meta data file saving 
        	- TMM
        - render with generated ground, shadowing, bounding volume
        - rotate, zoom
        - setting up model properties
        	- key, value map for what ever reason
    	- setting up the model pivot
    	- setting up a single bounding volume (for now)
    		- none
    		- sphere
    		- capsule
    		- bounding box
    		- oriented bounding box
    		- convex mesh
    	- see statistics
    		- opaque faces
    		- transparent faces
    		- material count

    - What is WIP
        - Use TDME-GUI instead of Nifty-GUI

    - Technology
    	- uses Nifty-GUI for GUI
        - uses TDME for rendering
        - platforms
            - Windows
            - Linux
            - Mac Os X
            - Android
