TDMEViewer
==========

    - What is it?
        - TDME based 3D model asset viewer 

    - What is already working
        - model loading
            - DAE, Wavefront OBJ, TM, TMM meta data files
        - model meta data file saving 
            - TMM
                - stores its model as TM file additionally
        - render with generated ground, shadowing, bounding volume
        - rotate, zoom
        - setting up model properties
            - key, value map for what ever reason
        - setting up the model pivot
        - setting up up to 8  bounding volumes (WIP)
            - none
            - sphere
            - capsule
            - bounding box
            - oriented bounding box
            - convex mesh
        - see statistics
            - opaque faces
            - transparent faces
            - material count

    - What is WIP
        - multiple bounding volumes per model
        - some other bug fixes that need to be resolved

    - Technology
        - uses TDME for rendering and GUI
        - platforms
            - Windows
            - Linux
            - Mac Os X
            - Android
