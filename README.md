TDME
====

    - What is it?
        - ThreeDeeMiniEngine is a small 3d engine suited for small 3d games written in JAVA

    - What is already working
        - 3d engine
            - model parsing
                - WaveFront OBJ
                - DAE parsing with skinned meshes and animations
                    - group names/ids must not have whitespace characters
                    - requires baked matrices
                - TDME Model file format
                    - this is a much more efficient model file format for TDME
                    - can be read and written
                - DAE and WaveFront OBJ files require triangulated meshes for now
            - object transformations
                - scaling
                - rotations
                - translation
            - animations
                - skinning can be computed on CPU or GPU
                - supports base animation and animation overlays
                - supports attaching objects to bones of another objects
            - color effects on objects
                - via shader
                - color addition
                - color multiplication
            - lighting via shaders
                - supports phong lighting

                - supports normal mapping on GL3
            - dynamic shadows via shaders
            - particle system which
              - is object based
              - or point based
              - and supports
                - basic/point emitter
                - sphere emitter

            - supports offscreen instances
                - rendering can be captured as screenshot
                - rendering can be used (in other engine instances) as diffuse texture
            - screenshot ability
            - multiple renderer
              - GL2, GL3(core) and GLES2

                - oriented bounding boxes
                - triangle
                - convex mesh
            - rigid body simulator
              - broadphase collision detection
                  - uses oct tree like partitioning from 16mx16mx16m up to 4mx4mx4m
                  - additionally sphere <> sphere test
              - narrowphase collision detection

        - GUI system
            - borrows some ideas from Nifty-GUI regarding XML and layouting
            - borrows some ideas from AngularJS like
                - all nodes are in the GUI node tree and can be made visible or unvisible depending on conditions
            - adds some improvements like
                - support auto keyword with nodes width and height attributes
            - supported primitive nodes from which compounds are built of
                - element

                - tabs
            - supports position and color based effects
    - What does it (maybe still) lack
        - animation blending
        - physics
          - multiple bounding volumes for a rigid body
          - rag doll / joints / springs
        - example games
        - documentation

    - What is WIP
        - rigid body simulator(needs to be updated to newer "ReactPhysics3D 0.5")

    - Technology
        - designed for simple multi threading
            - 3d engine uses one thread for now
            - physics or game mechanics can run in a separate thread(s)
        - uses JOGL, JOAL, JOrbis-0.0.17
        - platforms
            - Windows
            - Linux
            - Mac Os X
            - Android

    - Tools
        - TDME Model Viewer, see README-Viewer.md
        - TDME Level Editor, see README-LevelEditor.md
