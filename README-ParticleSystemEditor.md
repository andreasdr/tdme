TDMEParticleSystem
==================

    - What is it?
        - TDME based particle system editor 

    - What is already working
        - particle system loading
        - particle system saving
        - render with generated ground, shadowing, bounding volume
        - setting up particle system properties
            - key, value map for what ever reason
        - setting up type
            - object particle system
            - point particle system
        - setting up emitter
            - point particle emitter
            - bounding box particle emitter
            - circle particle emitter
            - circle particle emitter with velocity on circle plane
            - sphere particle emitter
        - setting up up to 8 bounding volumes
            - none
            - sphere
            - capsule
            - bounding box
            - oriented bounding box
            - convex mesh
